Overview
--------
This module generates text bar graphs based on data sent to it in a hash.

Contributors
------------
Robert Eric Pearse <pearse@robertpearse.com>: Numeric key sorting

Requirements
------------
If you want the module to automatically determine the size of your screen
when generating a graph, you will need the Term::ReadKey module, which you
can get from http://search.cpan.org. If you request the graph to be
automatically sized, and the module is not there, it will silently revert
to 80 columns.

Term::ANSIColor is used if available. Raw ANSI escape sequences are used
otherwise.

Installation
------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
