You can find any updates at:

or at http://search.cpan.org

Overview
--------
This module generates text bar graphs based on data sent to it in a hash.

Contributors
------------
Robert Eric Pearse <pearse@robertpearse.com>: Numeric key sorting

Requirements
------------
If you want the module to automatically determine the size of your screen
when generating a graph, you will need the Term::ReadKey module, which you
can get from http://search.cpan.org. If you request the graph to be
automatically sized, and the module is not there, it will silently revert
to 80 columns.

Changes in v0.3
---------------
 - Added ability to sort keys numerically

Changes in v0.2
----------------

 - Fixed autosize so that if the Term::ReadKey module is not available, or
   if STDOUT is not a terminal, it won't attempt to autosize.

 - Added "color" feature, to colorcode the graph based on the size of the
   bars

Installation
------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Usage
-----

$g = Text::BarGraph->new();
  
%hash = (
  alpha => 30,
  beta  => 40,
  gamma => 25
);      

print $g->graph(\%hash);

An example program is included that explains all of the options.
