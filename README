---------------------
Text::BarGraph  v0.02
---------------------

Copyright (c) 2001 Kirk Baucom.  All rights reserved.  This
module can be distributed or modified under the 'Artistic License',
as distributed with Perl.


Overview
--------

This module generates text bar graphs based on data sent to it in a hash.


Requirements
------------

If you want the module to automatically determine the size of your screen
when generating a graph, you will need the Term::ReadKey module, which should
have come with your standard perl distribution. If you request the graph
to be automatically sized, and the module is not there, it will silently
revert to 80 columns.

Changes in v0.02
----------------

 - Fixed autosize so that if the Term::ReadKey module is not available, or
   if STDOUT is not a terminal, it won't attempt to autosize.

 - Added "color" feature, to colorcode the graph based on the size of the
   bars

Installation
------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Usage
-----

$g = Text::BarGraph->new();
  
%hash = (
  alpha => 30,
  beta  => 40,
  gamma => 25
);      

print $g->graph(\%hash);

An example program is included that explains all of the options.
