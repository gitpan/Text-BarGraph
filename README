Text::BarGraph

Copyright (c) 2001 Kirk Baucom.  All rights reserved.  This
module can be distributed or modified under the 'Artistic License',
as distributed with Perl.


Overview
--------

This module generates text bar graphs based on data sent to it in a hash.


Requirements
------------

If you want the module to automatically determine the size of your screen
when generating a graph, you will need the Term::Readkey module, which should
have come with your standard perl distribution.


Installation
------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Usage
-----

$g = Text::BarGraph->new();
  
%hash = (
  alpha => 30,
  beta  => 40,
  gamma => 25
);      

print $g->graph(\%hash);

An example program is included that explains all of the options.
